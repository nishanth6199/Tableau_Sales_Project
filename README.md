This dataset provides an overview of sales data within a company and consists of five tables. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing within SQL Workbench before being imported into Tableau. The primary objective was to leverage data visualization to uncover insights into the reasons behind the company's sales decline. The analysis of these visualizations led to the identification of potential issues that may have contributed to the company's downturn.
